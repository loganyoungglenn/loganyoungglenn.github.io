    "title": "Did the Virginia Cavaliers Deserve to Make the 2024 NCAA Tournament?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Virginia Cavaliers were one of the last four teams to receive a bid into this year’s NCAA Tournament, meaning they had to participate in the play-in game. They went up against Colorado State in a 10-seed vs 10-seed matchup. The game was one of the most unexciting games of the year and the Cavaliers walked into the locker room at the half with only 14 points and a deficit of 13. Needless to say, both schools did not start their tournament runs great however, Colorado State picked it up in the second half scoring 40 points and beating Virginia 67-42. This set an outcry among fans for teams who were right there on the bubble and didn’t receive a bid to the tournament. Many of these fans believed that their bubble teams should have taken one of the final spots in the NCAA Tournament over the Cavaliers.\nLooking at the 2024 Pomeroy Ratings, a ranking system that evaluates several different statistics including adjusted efficiency margin, Virginia did not stand out compared to other non-tournament teams in overall rankings, sitting at 68th in the rankings. More specifically below shows where Virginia stands next to non-tournament teams in offensive and defensive efficiency.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nnet &lt;- read_csv(\"netwl.csv\")\nkenpom &lt;- read_csv(\"kenpomwl.csv\")\n\nteams &lt;- c(\"Virginia\",\"Pittsburgh\",\"Wake Forest\",\"Villanova\",\"Indiana St.\",\"Cincinnati\",\"Oklahoma\",\"St. John's\",\"Seton Hall\",\"Colorado St.\",\"Nevada\",\"Boise St.\",\"Colorado\")\ntourneyteam &lt;- c(\"Virginia\",\"Colorado St.\",\"Nevada\",\"Boise St.\",\"Colorado\")\nnontourneyteam &lt;- c(\"Pittsburgh\",\"Wake Forest\",\"Villanova\",\"Indiana St.\",\"Cincinnati\",\"Oklahoma\",\"St. John's\",\"Seton Hall\", \"Providence\")\n\nbubblet &lt;- kenpom |&gt;\n  arrange(Rk) |&gt;\n  filter( Team %in% teams) \n\nmadeit &lt;- kenpom |&gt;\n  arrange(Rk) |&gt;\n  filter( Team %in% tourneyteam)\n\nnitbound &lt;- kenpom |&gt;\n  arrange(Rk) |&gt;\n  filter( Team %in% nontourneyteam)\n\nvi &lt;- kenpom |&gt;\n  filter( Team == \"Virginia\")\n\nggplot() +\n  scale_size(range = c(5, 10), name=\"Adjusted Efficiency\") +\n  geom_point(data=vi, aes(x=AdjO, y=AdjD, size= AdjEM...6),\n             color=\"#F84C1E\",\n                      alpha = 1) +\n  scale_size(range = c(5, 10), name=\"Adjusted Efficiency\") +\n  geom_point(data=nitbound, aes(x=AdjO, y=AdjD, size= AdjEM...6),\n             color=\"#009CDE\",\n                      alpha = 1)  +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=nitbound,\n    aes(x=AdjO, y=AdjD, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=vi,aes(x=AdjO + .2, y=AdjD, label=Team)\n  ) +\n  labs(x=\"Offensive Efficiency\", y=\"Defensive Efficiency\", title=\"Adjusted Efficiency Between Virginia and Non-Tournament Teams\", subtitle=\"Look where Virginia falls amongst these teams in terms of efficiency!\", caption=\"Source: Kenpom | By Logan Young-Glenn\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text( size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, Virginia separates itself from the others by a wide margin. This is both a good thing and a bad thing for the Cavaliers. Virginia’s defense showed itself throughout the year to be one of the best in the country and ranked 7th in defensive-adjusted efficiency among all schools. If it were up to just defensive ability, Virginia shows that they 100% deserved a spot in this year’s tournament. It’s not until you look at the offensive side that makes things a tiny bit tricky. Virginia had the 200th-best offense in the country in terms of offensive-adjusted efficiency which is somewhat remarkable for such a good defensive team. Virginia had the best defense among the teams shown above yet they also had the worst offense. There’s one thing to help counteract the two which is the overall adjusted efficiency margin. The Cavaliers rank last in this statistic as well among the respective teams shown above with an AdjEM of +11.80. Other teams like Indiana State and conference opponent Wake Forest, had AdjEMs of +16.69 and +19.89. Virginia lacks in AdjEM as well as their offensive efficiency when compared to teams on the other side of the bubble, including two conference opponents. This is not a good start for Virginia in terms of showing why they deserved one of the final spots over other bubble teams.\n\n\nCode\nsportsref &lt;- read_csv(\"sportsref.csv\")\n\nschoolsr &lt;- c(\"Virginia\",\"Pittsburgh\",\"Wake Forest\",\"Villanova\",\"Indiana State\",\"Cincinnati\",\"Oklahoma\",\"St. John's (NY)\",\"Seton Hall\", \"Providence\")\n\nbubblesr &lt;- sportsref |&gt;\n  arrange(Rk) |&gt;\n  filter( School %in% schoolsr)\n\nbigmbb &lt;- sportsref |&gt; \n  filter(School %in% bubblesr)|&gt;\n  select(School, SRS, SOS, W, L) |&gt;\n  group_by(School) |&gt;\n  select(School, SRS, SOS, W, L) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(SRS)) \n\ntbl &lt;- bubblesr |&gt;\n  select(School, SRS, SOS, W, L) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(-School), as.numeric) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(SRS))\n\n tbl |&gt; gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    School = \"Team\",\n    SRS = \"Simple Rating\",\n    SOS = \"Schedule Strength\",\n    W = \"Wins\",\n    L = \"Losses\"\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Logan Young-Glenn  |  **Source:** [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/men/2024-advanced-school-stats.html)\")\n  )|&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=14)\n     )\n   )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#232D4B\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#F84C1E\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = School == \"Virginia\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How Does Virginia's Simple Rating Compare to Teams That Did Not Make the Tournament?\",\n    subtitle = \"The Cavaliers are dead last in simple rating compared to teams on the opposite side of the bubble!

Using the Simple Rating System, Virginia looked absolutely out of the tournament on Selection Sunday. The Cavaliers’ Simple Rating was last when compared to nine other bubble teams that all did not make the tournament. St. John’s led the remaining teams while playing in the conference that produced this year’s champion, UConn. The Big East is also home to Villanova, Seton Hall, and Providence who had a better Simple Rating and Strength of Schedule than Virginia. Many believed that the Big East in general was snubbed on one or more bids compared to conferences like the ACC and the SEC. Seton Hall stands out of the four Big East schools as they were one of three teams to knockoff UConn this year. Another important thing to note is that ACC opponents Wake Forest and Pittsburgh hold higher Simple Ratings and Strength of Schedules than Virginia. Virginia only seems to stand out when it comes to the loss column as they lead all schools except one as they were only defeated 11 times this season. This is better than every team besides Indiana State whose Strength of Schedule is by far the worst among the group and is the only non-power five team listed.\n\n\nCode\nconf &lt;- read_csv(\"srconf.csv\")\n\ntourneyt &lt;- c(\"Virginia\",\"Colorado State\",\"Wagner\",\"Howard\",\"Grambling\",\"Montana State\",\"Oakland\",\"Kentucky\",\"Michigan State\",\"Mississippi State\",\"Duquesne\",\"Brigham Young\",\"Akron\",\"Creighton\",\"Long Beach State\",\"Arizona\",\"North Carolina\",\"Morehead State\",\"Illinois\",\"Oregon\",\"Soutch Carolina\",\"Nevada\",\"Dayton\",\"South Dakota State\",\"Texas\",\"Iowa State\",\"Mcneese State\",\"Gonzaga\",\"Saint Peter's\",\"Tennessee\",\"NC State\",\"Texas Tech\",\"Drake\",\"Washinghton State\",\"Samford\",\"Kansas\",\"Texas A&M\",\"Nebraska\",\"Northwestern\",\"Florida Atlantic\",\"Colgate\",\"Baylor\",\"UAB\",\"San Diego State\",\"Western Kentucky\",\"Marquette\",\"New Mexico\",\"Clemson\",\"Stetson\",\"Connecticut\",\"Yale\",\"Auburn\",\"Colorado\",\"Florida\",\"Vermont\",\"Duke\",\"Purdue\",\"Charleston\",\"Alabama\",\"Houston\",\"Longwood\",\"James Madison\",\"Wisconsin\",\"TCU\",\"Utah State\",\"Grand Canyon\",\"Saint Mary's\",\"Boise State\")\nschoolsrc &lt;- c(\"Virginia\",\"Pittsburgh\",\"Wake Forest\",\"Villanova\",\"Indiana State\",\"Cincinnati\",\"Oklahoma\",\"St. John's (NY)\",\"Seton Hall\", \"Providence\")\n\nconferences &lt;- c(\"ACC\", \"BTEN\", \"BIG12\", \"PAC12\", \"BE\", \"MWC\", \"SEC\")\n\nvcc &lt;- c(\"Virginia\")\n\nvirgin &lt;- conf |&gt;\n  arrange(Rk) |&gt;\n  filter( School %in% vcc)\n\ntourn &lt;- conf |&gt;\n  arrange(Rk) |&gt;\n  filter( School %in% tourneyt) |&gt;\n  filter( Conference %in% conferences)\n\npower &lt;- conf|&gt;\n  filter( Conference %in% conferences)\n\notourn &lt;- conf |&gt;\n  arrange(Rk) |&gt;\n  filter( School %in% schoolsrc)|&gt;\n  filter( Conference %in% conferences)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=power, \n    aes(x=SRS, y=Conference), color=\"#009CDE\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=tourn, \n    aes(x=SRS, y=Conference), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=virgin, \n    aes(x=SRS, y=Conference), color=\"#F84C1E\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=virgin,\n    aes(x=SRS, y=Conference, label=School)) +\n  labs(x=\"Conference\", y=\"Simple Rating\", title=\"Virginia's Simple Rating Compared to Other Power Conference Teams\", subtitle=\"Virginia is trailing other power conference teams who didn't make the tournament.\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Logan Young-Glenn\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text( size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpanding further on Virginia’s Simple Rating is showing where they stand among the best conferences in college basketball this season. To start, the Cavaliers’ in-state rival Virginia Tech held a higher Simple Rating to add on with Wake Forest and Pittsburgh in the ACC. The Big East had six schools in total who did not make the tournament but held a higher Simple Rating than the Cavaliers. Another reason to believe that the Big East was snubbed on Selection Sunday. The Big 12 had four non-tournament teams with a higher Simple Rating than Virginia while both the Big Ten and the Pac-12 had three teams. The SEC only had one team with a higher Simple Rating than Virginia while the six-bid Mountain West had zero! Overall, Virginia should not have received a bid on Selection Sunday based on both their adjusted efficiency margin and their simple rating. The Cavaliers showed this on the court on the opening night of the tournament when they were blown out by Colorado State. The Cavaliers’ past five tournaments have been unlike anything the world has ever seen before as Virginia was knocked out by 16-seed UMBC in 2018, 13-seed Ohio in 2021, 13-seed Furman in 2023, and now 10-seed Colorado State. The craziest part of this all is that Virginia won it all in 2019 beating Texas Tech in overtime 85-77 as the number one overall seed!"
